# Goal: 
To have an African wide online database for the value chain of Covi-19 (not limited to it). Allowing location and providing resources from one trusted source.  

Driven with crowd intelligence.  Platform is to bring together those with needs and those who can supply those. Focus is data sharing, not service provider.

Current focus is therefor (raw) Material (required to produce masks, sanitizers, protective gears, soap, water, 3D location, 3D raw material), transport, hospital (capacity), finance (organizations, agents (digital money). 

Quality: Entry such as a company, is simplified by querying own DB and Google / other local (online DBs). Continues effort to drill down, such as from country, (west, north), district, sub-district, city, ect.

(second stage after reach of X dataset) verifications of owners is done for example with SMS or email all references. Important is to get as much data into the system as possible. Then restrictions follow later.

Rating ensures feedback from the community providing it tool to estimate or to build up trust.

To finance future development advertisement will be key too and positioning. Donation should be visible (Cryptocurrency, PayPal, Mobile Money)

## Navigation
Chatbot can lead visitor through system such as greeting, asking for what is search and location. With our data in hand, suggestions can be given according to request and location.  Eg. Visitor says he is in Germany and needs mask. Here we refer to a site (if we know) that might help further with the info’s that we currently hold dataset only for Uganda or countries to add).

##Map 
Map gives an overview. Once location is known it should zoom in that area. Once need is known, only those providers should be listed. A click on one reveals the data (such as name, how many supplied, rating, link to contacts).

Integration is key – for such an API is key from start. Upload should be possible too such as list of Hotels.

Statistics is key, such as most searches, so we focus on getting more data in those areas. While giving also priorities by asking – are you a fashion designer, can you make masks, do yo?
